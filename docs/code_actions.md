## Code actions

Code actions are applicable code transformations.

- In [coc.nvim], they can be triggered on cursor position via `<Plug>(coc-codeaction-cursor)`,
which by default binds to `<leader>ac`.

- In [VSCode], they can be triggered by clicking the lightbulb :bulb: icon
  at the beginning of the cursor line.

Here is the list of all implemented code actions, sorted by their `mod` name in code
`crates/ide/src/ide/assists`.
Currently documentations below are simply copied from doc-comments of their `mod`s.

### `add_to_top_level_lambda_param`

Add an undefined name to the top-level lambda.

```nix
{ foo }: foo + bar
```
=>
```nix
{ foo, bar }: foo + bar
```

### `convert_to_inherit`

Convert `path = value;` into `inherit key;`.

This covers,
- `prefix.key = key;` => `prefix = { inherit key; };`
Here the `prefix` set mut not be `rec`. The code before is actually
an infinite recursion while the code after is not.
- `prefix.key = from.key;` => `prefix = [rec] { inherit (from) key; };`
Since the `from` is resolved in the `prefix` scope thus
it is allowed to have recursive references (but may not be infinite recursion).

### `flatten_attrset`

Flatten binding with Attrset RHS into multiple bindings of outer level.
FIXME: Indentations are not reformatted well.

```nix
{
foo = {
    bar = 1;
    baz = 2;
};
}
```
=>
```nix
{
foo.bar = 1;
foo.baz = 2;
}
```

### `pack_bindings`

Pack one or more implicit bindings of implicit Attrset into explicit nested one.
FIXME: Indentations are not reformatted well.

```nix
{
foo.bar = 1;
foo.baz = 2;
}
```
=>
```nix
{
foo = {
    bar = 1;
    baz = 2;
};
}
```

### `quote_attr` and `unquote_attr`

Rewrite between attribute names and double quoted strings
```nix
{ foo = bar; }
```
<=>
```nix
{ "foo" = bar; }
```

### `remove_empty_inherit`

Remove empty `inherit;` or `inherit (...);`.

```nix
{ foo = "bar"; inherit; }
```
=>
```nix
{ foo = "bar"; }
```

### `remove_empty_let_in`

Remove empty `let in ...`.
```nix
let in { foo = "bar"; }
```
=>
```nix
{ foo = "bar"; }
```

### `remove_unused_binding`

Remove an unused pattern binding.

```nix
{ foo, bar }: { foo = 1; }
```
=>
```nix
{ foo }: { foo = 1; }
```

Or, remove an unused let binding.

```nix
let
  foo.bar = 1;
  foo.baz = 2;
in {}
```
=>
```nix
let
in {}
```

### `rewrite_string_to_indented` and `rewrite_indented_to_string`

Rewrite between double quoted strings and indented strings

```nix
"foo\nbar\n"
```
=>
```nix
''
  foo
  bar
''
```

### `rewrite_uri_to_string`

Rewrite URI literals to double quoted strings
```nix
https://nixos.org
```
=>
```nix
"https://nixos.org"
```

### `inline`

Rewrite a binding to its definition.
```nix
let id = x: x; in a 1
```
=>
```nix
let id = x: x; in (x: x) 1
```


### `add_to_inherit`

Append an unbound variable to a let-inherit-in clause in scope.
```nix
let inherit (lib) mkMerge;
in  mkForce
```
=>
```nix
let inherit (lib) mkMerge mkForce;
in  mkForce
```
